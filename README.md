The RTL source code for “FPGA-based Multithreading for In-Memory Hash Joins” presented at CIDR’15. A copy of the paper can be found [HERE](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper12.pdf). 

## Notes
- This repository does not include any source code to interface with the Convey MX architecture as done in the paper. 
- It is also missing two IP cores, fifo_64x512, and mul_48, which will need to be generated for synthesis.
